To run the code you need to visit thonny.org and atom.io
Install both programs, when you install Atom go into C drive, Users and find your user. This is where your code will be saved. Thonny will automatically save here
Visit http://appjar.info/ and download the appjar file. Unzip it and drag the file into where your code is saved. C drive, users and then your user.
Once Thonny is installed, press on tools and and press 'open system shell'
Once open, type - pip3 install webbrowser - this will install webbrowser, if it comes up saying it can't find it this is okay, just continue.
Now open up code.py
